Day 12 - Collab 1: Indexing & Multi-DB Retrieval Showdown

What this script does:
1. Loads hardcoded Wikipedia-style article summaries and splits them into chunks.
2. Embeds every chunk with a local HashingVectorizer embedder.
3. Builds a local FAISS index and benchmarks top-k retrieval.
4. Optionally benchmarks Pinecone when PINECONE_API_KEY is filled in .env.
5. Optionally benchmarks Azure AI Search hybrid search when Azure values are filled in .env.
6. Optionally applies Cohere reranking when COHERE_API_KEY is filled in .env.

Required packages:
    pip install langchain-core langchain-text-splitters faiss-cpu numpy pandas matplotlib tqdm scikit-learn

Optional packages:
    pip install pinecone azure-search-documents azure-core cohere
